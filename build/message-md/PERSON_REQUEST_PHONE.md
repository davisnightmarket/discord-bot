OK thanks!

Next up: may we have your phone number?

Phone number is used by Night Captains to connect directly and coordinate pickups. You may also use the Discord channel to do that, however a cell phone can can make Night Cap's job easier.

Once again:

You can simply reply and type it in this DM channel.
You may decline to share it by typing "decline".

May we have your phone number please?
