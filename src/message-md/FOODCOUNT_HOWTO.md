#### How to food count:

-   Enter a night channel: {{nightChannelNameList}}
-   Enter the name of the pickup, and the amount of food in pounds, like so: `{{foodcountExample}}`
-   If you made a mistake, you can cancel and do it again!

As a reminder, you do not have to be perfect. No one is expected to break out the hang scales. An estimate is good enough. Any entry at all is better than none!
Here's some helper tips tho:

-   a slice of pizza weighs `.5lbs`
-   a loaf of bread weighs `2lbs`
