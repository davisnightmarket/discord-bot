Hello Marketeer {{username}},
I am {{botname}}, a Discord bot whose job it is to welcome you to {{marketLocation}} Night Market, get you oriented, and help you do stuff.

First off, we would like to collect some contact information for you, so that our Community Coordinators and Night Captains can be in touch.

We will start by asking for your email address.
You can simply reply and type it in this DM channel.
You may decline to share it by typing "decline".
FYI, our policy is to never share your contact information with anyone outside of the organization. You may always delete your contact completely from our system by interacting with me, or by asking a Community Coordinator to do it for you.

May we have your email address please?
