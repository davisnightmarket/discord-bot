# Night Market Discord Bot

## What does this do?

Let's play around and figure out what we want it to do.

## How do I run it?

### Step #1: The Environment

You need npm installed and the code downloaded

### Step #2: Configure it

Create a file called config.json.
It should look like this:

```
{
    "token": "<the secret token>"
}
```

### Step #3: Run it!

run `npm start` in the folder with the code

## How does it work?

I recomend reading https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome to get started.

Okay, this will (mostly) assume that you know how javascript and the discord api works.
Hopefully even if you don't this will still be interesting and informative.

So... todo.
