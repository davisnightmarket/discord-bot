# Night Market Discord Bot is "crabapple"

## What does the bot do?

It's current main feature is to help people add to the food count, but it's always open to suggestions!

## How do I run crabapple for local dev?

You will need node, npm and the code downloaded.

Then get the credentials from someone on the night-teck team. Once they are sent to you place them in the base of this directory.

The first time you run it, use `npm i` in the folder with the code to download the dependencies.

After that, just run `npm run dev` in the folder with the code to boot crabapple up. It will automatically recompile and restart it when you edit the code.

## How does crabapple work?

I recomend reading https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome to get started.

Okay, this will (mostly) assume that you know how javascript and the discord api works.
Hopefully even if you don't this will still be interesting and informative.
