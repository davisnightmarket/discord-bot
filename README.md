# Night Market Discord Bot

## What does the bot do?

It's current main feature is to help people add to the food count, but it's always open to suggestions! 

## How do I run it?

### Step #1: The Environment

You need npm installed and the code downloaded

### Step #2: Configure it

Create a file called `.env`
It should look like this:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<the secret token>
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1055518718244966471
```

Then gets the keys.json for google from someone who allready has them (we need a better way of sharing secrets in the future).

### Step #3: Run it!

run `npm start` in the folder with the code

## How does it work?

I recomend reading https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome to get started.

Okay, this will (mostly) assume that you know how javascript and the discord api works.
Hopefully even if you don't this will still be interesting and informative.

So... todo.
