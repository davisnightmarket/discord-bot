# Night Market Discord Bot is "crabapple"

## What does crabapple do?

-   Inventory Component
    -   allows food-count to be input in our night channels and tallied in a Google spreadsheet

## How do I run crabapple for local dev?

-   You need node and npm installed and the code downloaded
-   You need a zip file with credentials for Google and Discord. Get from night-tech team.
-   from the repo root run:
    -   `npm install`
    -   `npm start`

## How does crabapple work?

I recomend reading https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/general/welcome to get started.

Okay, this will (mostly) assume that you know how javascript and the discord api works.
Hopefully even if you don't this will still be interesting and informative.

## todo

-   draw up schema for onboarding component
-   come up with other ideas for functionality
